    <p>Crème Brûlée is an elegant dessert made of 5 simple ingredients. Contrary to popular belief this is not a difficult dish to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups light/heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>half a cup of sugar, more for the topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 160 degrees celcius. In a saucepan combine the cream, vanilla bean and salt. Cook over low heat until just hot. After letting it sit for a few minutes the vanilla bean can be discarded. If vanilla extract is being used instead it should be added at this point.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir in roughly a quarter of the cream, then pour in the sugar-egg mixture into the cream and stir.</li>
        <li>Pour into four ramekins and place them into a baking dish. Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up to the sides of the dishes.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the centers are barely set. Cool completely, then refrigerate for several hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within two hours.</li>
    </ol>
